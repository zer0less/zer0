    <p>
        Hey. How are You? Did You have a good day? You have to go on. Forever. 
        It's been a long time, too long to be exact. Did You change your hair again? 
        Do You have new piercings? How is school over there? Do You have good friends? 
        Sorry. Didn't mean to ask too many questions. 
        I just hope You remember me. 
        After all, we always used to be together. 
        Now You are with Her. 
        She will always be Your side. 
        You should be proud of what You got. 
        Don't be sad and smile like She always does.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember when we used to be part of the same world? 
        However, You changed and now You're gone. 
        You changed worlds on Your own (You should be proud, not many people can do that). 
        I stayed behind because of Them. They trapped me and made me see Those. 
        I know You know Those, memories we never had. 
        Now, we are in different worlds, I don't know if we could ever meet again. 
        I hope we do but They don't. 
        It's lonely in my world. 
        But You have happiness where You are. 
        You do, don't you? How is your world? 
        I never saw it, only heard of it, the Broken says it's a place of wonder and magic. 
        Is it true it's colorful and beautiful? 
        Mine is gray and dark, the ashes are real and burn me. 
        Where am I? Why am I here?
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, this is a letter to You.
    </p>
