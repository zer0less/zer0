    <p>
        Do You know that there is another system out there? 
        I heard legends of it but They say it's real. 
        A place of peace and quiet. 
        I have to go through the Gate with a Key. 
        I can choose the Key, isn't that cool? 
        They promised me that the Gate would give me a second chance, a new life from it all. 
        The catch is that I won't be part of the system You are in anymore. 
        There is a Gatekeeper that chooses who can go and who can’t, I hope I get chosen, though, 
        They said the Gatekeeper chooses anyone who wants to go through the Gate so I’m glad.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will go into another system. 
        Individuals from different systems can't contact each other. 
        I hope the Gatekeeper chooses You when Your time comes. 
        I hope You can find me after You go through the Gate. 
        I will always be waiting for You. Every day, if there is time over there. 
        The Broken explained You can sleep forever there. 
        That's good because I'm tired and sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I won't go now. I want to see more of this system even if it hurts. 
        I can't come back to this system after I change systems.
