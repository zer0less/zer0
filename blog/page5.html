    <h1>Art of Lying</h1>
    <p>
        I remember some Abstracts asking me why I don't speak. 
        I told them that it was because I'm shy and introverted. 
        A lie. The truth is that I hate how I speak. 
        I hate the words that come out of my mouth. 
        I hate that I don't know what is going to come out. 
        They control it and my words. 
        Words that make no sense and that make other worlders see that I'm part of the wrong world, an Anomaly.

    <p>
        It's too easy to lie. It's a skill I wish I never learned. 
        They told me that lying was beneficial to everyone: others and me. 
        I lied about being okay, about being happy, about being in love. 
        For what? Just to get close to people of different worlds. 
        “Do you need help?” “No, I'm okay.” 
        “Do you like this?“ “Yes, it looks good.” 
        The only truths were my friendships and the fact that I love cats.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Why are you here?” “I don't know, I wanted to join you.” 
        I even lost grasp of when was lying or telling the truth. 
        What is the truth? Is the truth even true? 
        I wanted to be with You though. 
        I wanted to be with you all. 
        Why did You reject me? Did I do something wrong? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I would use fake smiles and fake laughs to join conversations. 
        I couldn't understand what they were talking about. 
        Their words were dislocated and full of parasites when they reached me. 
        I could only hear whistles and see mouths moving. 
        My world burns the sounds and deflects your sight.
