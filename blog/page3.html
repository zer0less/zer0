    <h1>The Then</h1>
    <p>
        One's past sets what world they will be in at first. 
        Of course, one can change worlds, like You did. This is mine, my past.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's been such a long time but I still remember it. 
        That's the day They arrived. 
        They played with me and my emotions and my thoughts. 
        I went to a Hunter that could heal me. 
        However, They were too strong and the Hunter couldn't help me. 
        The Hunter gave me pills to keep Them away a bit, but They are still there. 
        I lost my sense of emotions. 
        I lost the sense of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        I no longer felt human. What am I? Who am I?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a Carrier of Them and Society doesn't like Carriers. 
        Carriers can become Brokens. Brokens go crazy when They get control. 
        Brokens do stupid shit and then cross the Gate. 
        I was rejected from life and happiness and Society. 
        Society doesn't like anyone from my world. My world became darker. 
        I went to the wrong world. The world where the future Brokens go. 
        The color disappeared and was replaced by gray and grey. 
        Society also calls us Anomalies because we go against the very rules of this system.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's all because of Them. Where did They come from? 
        I had to live with Them for a while and still do. 
        Every day I have to fight Them and control myself from Their control. 
        Can I go on like this? Am I going to go crazy? Am I going to become a Broken?
