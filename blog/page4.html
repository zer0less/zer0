    <p>
        One day, I met You, a person who went to the same world as me, and who understood what I was going through. 
        We saw the same. We felt the same. We were the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        People of my world can't be together with people of other worlds, it's not illegal, but not acceptable. Strongly not recommended. 
        Still, some of the other worlders would be with me even if I'm an Anomaly. 
        Society calls them Abstracts. 
        I met nice Abstracts that helped me through times. 
        We hung out with those Abstracts together. 
        They were nice people, we truly were lucky we met them. 
        What would we have done without them? Would we still be here?
    </p>
    <p>
        I am glad I met them and got to be with them. 
        But, never forget, they weren't in the same world as us. 
        Strangers to our views and beliefs. 
        That's what They tell me. 
        I want to believe everyone is the same even in different worlds but They and Society say no. 
        Is it because I don't have emotions like they do? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to be with You and Her and all of them. 
        But They kept me apart. Always alone and with Them. 
        I wanted to be invited, to be included, to be part of it all. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I met a lot of different people in my life. 
        Other Anomalies and Abstracts. Very nice people. Such nice people. 
        I had fun meeting all of them. 
        I couldn't tell them that my best years were with all of them. 
        Now, they are gone too and I couldn't thank them. 
        I hope I can see them someday again. Yeah, maybe someday. 
        Make sure They don't catch you and live with It always.

        Hello and Goodbye.
