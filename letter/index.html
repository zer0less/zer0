    <h1>Sorry Letter</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Friends, 
    </p>
    <p>
        My senior year and summer were by far the best moments I lived. 
        The best 18 year old birthday presents I could ask for. 
        I wish I could have enjoyed it more. 
        You were all so nice to me even though I never returned anything. 
        But my thoughts kept me from enjoying it with you all. 
        I know that hurt some of you. 
        But I also hurt myself in the process. 
        My health took a hit for the worse and my depression grew each day. 
        My thoughts were corrupted with dangerous information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I never thought about changing. 
        I kept doing the same thing everyday. 
        I tried to escape the reality I was living in by doing stuff including some that I regret. 
        I talked with strangers online. 
        I watched videos, shows, and small vids until my brain was fried. 
        Everyday I was tired and the sun hurt my already dry eyes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        But I must thank you all. 
        Without you all (and her), I don't think I would still be here today. 
        My mind would have taken control. 
        I used to think of doing it almost each day. 
        My mind was viewing each way I could do it. 
        One day, I tried to do it by drowning myself. 
        The salty tears mixed with the water. 
        My words were cut with the water. 
        I was breating water. 
        My lungs were screaming for air. 
        What am I doing? I don't want to quit like this. 
        The survival instinct of my body took control and brought me back up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        But now, I want to change. 
        Now, I want to be happier. 
        Now, I want to see the world in colors. 
        Now, I want to see the beautiful nature. 
        Now, I want to see it all. 
        Now, I want to be strong. 
        Now, I don't want to be always tired. 
        Now, I don't want to be depressed. 
        Now, I don't want to lie to everyone. 
        Now, I want to live.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to take back the time I lost with you all. 
        I didn't get to know you all like I wanted to. 
        I want to hang out with you all. 
        I want to laugh with you all. 
        I want to eat with you all. 
        I want to enjoy life with you all. 
        I am always up for anything so hit me up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am glad I was able to meet you all. 
        You truly are the best friends in the world. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerly, 
    </p>
    <p>
