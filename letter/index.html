    <h1>My Perfect Secret</h1>
    <p>
        Dear People, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Is there a point? 
        To it all? 
        Why do we leave here? 
        Where they are. 
        Are they poisonning my mind? 
        Am I just a puppet? 
    </p>
    <p>
        All this questions go round and round in my mind. 
        Am I supposed to follow them? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I follow Professor Josh's advices to try and fight them. 
        But nothing worked. 
        Nothing works. 
        No one works. 
        I hate it here. 
        Where we are. 
        No, where I am. 
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter how hard I try to  make friends. 
        Everyone goes away. 
        I always end up alone. 
        No one cares. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This world isn't perfect. 
        Do butterfly fly? 
        Is the color red truly red? 

    </p>
    <p>
        Why am I here? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerly, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Andrew
    </p>
